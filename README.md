# IoTSim-Stream (New Version 2.0 - Edge-enabled IoTSim-Stream)
Open-source simulation software to model and simulate stream workflow applications in cloud and edge computing environments.

## Unique Features
  * Support modelling data incentive IoT-based applications using stream processing model (aka stream graph applications).
  * Support modelling edge computing environment in addition to multicloud enviroment as an execution environment for stream graph application.
  * Support user-defined resource provisioning and scheduling policies.
