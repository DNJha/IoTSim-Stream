# IoTSim-Stream (New Version v2.0): Edge-enabled IoTSim-Stream
Extened simulator that enhances the capabilities of the IoTSim-Stream simulator by integrating an edge computing layer, allowing the execution of stream workflow applications on both edge and cloud environments. This extension in the extended simulator is developed by **Gursharn Kaur Soni**.

## Unique Features
  * Support modelling data incentive IoT-based applications using stream processing model (aka stream graph applications).
  * Support modelling edge computing environment in addition to multicloud enviroment as an execution environment for stream graph application.
  * Support user-defined resource provisioning and scheduling policies.


# IoTSim-Stream (v1.0 amd v1.1)
